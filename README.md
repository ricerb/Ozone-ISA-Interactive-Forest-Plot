# Ozone ISA Interactive Forest Plot Prototype

A Python Dash app presenting epidemiological study results from the 2019 Ozone ISA in a filterable format.

## Requirements

Global installation requirements:

1. Install Python 3.7

In the root directory of the application:

1. Install Pandas

2. Install Dash and its dependencies

3. Install Plotly and Plotly Express

## Usage

Data from tables 3-13 (Hospital Admissions for Asthma) and 3-14 (Emergency Department Visits for Asthma) in the 2019 Ozone ISA (draft) are presented in a filterable format in this Python Dash app. This is intended as a proof of concept for evaluating the usefulness of an interactive data visualization in future digital assessments. Note that study results presented as relative risk or percent increase values were converted to odds ratios to create this app.
